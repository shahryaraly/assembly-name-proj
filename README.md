### Prerequisites
download TASM from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guitasm8086/)

### Installation
1. install TASM/MASM/NASM based on OS
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shahryaraly/assembly-name-proj
   ```
3. open tasm/masm/nasm installed in your machine w.r.t OS
4. Use the following command line to assemble your source file, This will create a file named test.o in the current directory.
N.B. This file is not executable. It is still an object file:
  ```sh 
  tasm/masm/nasm project.asm
  ```
5. Now that we have our object file, named project.o, we must create our executable.
  ```sh 
  tlink project
  ```
6. Now, your executable is created, tested, and located in the current directory, To run the program called **project**, just type this command:
  ```sh 
  project
  ```
